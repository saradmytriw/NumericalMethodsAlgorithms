# NumericalMethodsAlgorithms
These algorithms perform numerical methods to obtain function roots or integrate functions. I created them all in the spring of 2019 while enrolled in a Mechanical engineering numerical methods course at Colorado State University
    
## Disclaimer
None of these algorithms are perfect and could all use some improvements
