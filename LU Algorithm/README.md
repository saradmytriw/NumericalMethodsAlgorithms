# luFactor
The algorithm uses LU Decomposition to produce L and U matrices which can be used to solve a system of equations. It also makes use of partial pivoting as tracked by the P matrix.

Inputs

    A - a coefficient matrix equivalent to the system of equations
    
Outputs

    L - the lower triangular matrix
    U - the upper triangular matrix
    P - the pivot matrix
    
## Possible Improvements
1. The algorithm is a function so it should not ask the user to input the A matrix
