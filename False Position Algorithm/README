# falsePosition
This algorithm uses the False Position method to obtain the roots of a function.

Inputs 

    func - the function being evaluted 
    xl - the lower guess
    xu - the upper guess
    es - the desired relative error
    maxiter  -the number of desired iterations
    
Outputs

    root - the estimated root location
    fx - the function evaluated at the root location
    ea - the approximate relative error
    iter - how many iterations were performed
