# Simpson
This algorithm makes use of the Simpson's 1/3 Rule to integrate tabulated data. The algorithm will make use of the trapezoidal rule in the case that the data requires it because of the number of terms.

Inputs

    x - the vector of values that the integral will be taken with respect to
    y - the vector of function values that correlate to x
    
Outputs

    I - the integral
